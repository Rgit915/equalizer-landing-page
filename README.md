## My process


### Built with

- HTML 5
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in utilizing Sass for efficient styling, including organizing code into partials, using variables for consistent theming, and applying mixins for responsive design. This approach enhanced maintainability and allowed me to make global style adjustments more easily.


### Continued development

For future projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of advanced Sass features for dynamic styling. Additionally, I plan to explore integrating Sass with CSS methodologies like BEM for more scalable and reusable styles.
